                        <p> Hello, I’m Anya and I am studying for a MSc in Petroleum Geoscience at Imperial.  University life has been an incredible and life-changing experience for me; I love learning such a diverse and multi-disciplinary subject, living in the beautiful city of London and challenging myself to try new hobbies/ make new friends. However, my masters is extremely intense and I’ve struggled to maintain a healthy work/life balance, especially around exams and university project deadlines.  After a big deadline or project, I often enjoy a day or two of doing nothing, just to keep my sanity! However, this year I have strived to become a better version of “ME” and to take better care of myself. I do this by cooking healthy yet delicious meals, treating myself to new cuisines with friends, and going to high intensity interval training gym classes, to sweat out all the toxins.  When I’m feeling down and alone I often put on my favourite song and sing my blues away; I find listening to music and singing along heals my soul in times of desperation. My advice for other female students would be to find time for yourself, often we are too worried about pleasing everyone in our life which often adds unhealthy stress to an already busy life. Personally, I recommend spending your Sunday night putting on a face mask, lighting some scented candles, eating a little bit of dark chocolate and watching your favourite feel-good movie. Although I don’t meditate very often, I started using the app headspace recently to meditate and I find it’s a peaceful way to remember we are just human beings and our body deserves to rest and be listened to! My best advice for when you are feeling lost, alone or overwhelmed at university is to ask a friend for a big hug, take 5 deep breathes in and out and finally watch a good old episode of friends to make you laugh!

                              <p> Hi! My name is Shahd and I'm a 4th year Civil Engineering student at Imperial College London. To me, I was a bit undecided about university. On one hand, the new-found freedom as a young adult exposed to exciting and boundless adventures was simply euphoric. On the other hand, moving away from home, to a completely different continent, for the first time was terrifying. The extensive workload and having to juggle countless responsibilities; bills, finances, cooking, cleaning, socialising, staying healthy... There were moments where I was tempted to drop everything, hop on a plane and just take off...head home. However, I was stubborn and being a quitter is definitely not one of my qualities. So I stuck around, started playing volleyball, frequently exercising, eating healthy, joined societies and even solo travelling. I've been to France, Italy, Spain and plan to visit Switzerland and Germany soon. My advice for other female students is: find what makes YOU feel good about YOU. We're all humans and we're bound to hit rock bottom but no worries! "When God closes a door, somewhere He opens a window", so have faith in yourself and work on improving your health, body and state of mind and everything will work out in the end.
