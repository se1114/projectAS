      <h3> Amy's Story</h3>
      <img src="../images/Amy.jpg" alt="Live Performance" width="220" height="220">
        <p> Hiya ladies, I'm Amy! I'm currently on my 4th year of my 6-year medical
          program at Kings College London. I've personally found university life AMAZING!
          The cultural enrichment that I've encountered is eye-opening. Despite my busy
          schedule between hospital rounds, running Hindu society at Kings and competing
          at dance competitions across the UK, I try to keep myself sane. I'm a strong
          believer in meditation and prayer and how it helped me cope the past 4 years
          of uni. I often keep a little book of gratitude where I note down all the things
          I'm grateful for, and helps make me reflect and stay positive. When I need a break,
          I often sit down with friends or watch my favorite TV show (you guessed, Grey's Anatomy!).
          My advice for female students is: Emotional control is key. Be strong about how you feel
          and stand up for yourself. You are AWESOME and capable of breaking the glass ceiling.

        <h3> Clio's Story </h3>
        <img src="../images/Clio.jpg" alt="Girl in a lab coat" width="220" height="250">
          <p>Hi my name is Clio, and I study English at the University of Bristol!
                  I find university is characterised by intense highs and intense lows,
                  where deadlines often make me overwhelmed. To stay positive I exercise
                  regularly, often I do workouts from Youtube in the comfort of my own bedroom!
                  I also try to leave the house, for no particular reason other than to be outside
                  and I love to cook wholesome meals! My advice for other female students is to find other
                  women that you bond with over specific problems, especially other people from ethnic minorities.
                  Remember men are too privileged often to understand your problems or they’re trying to offset
                  their own with yours. My other advice is to drink tea, wear an outfit that makes you feel great
                  and exercise as often as possible even if you feel lethargic. I used to meditate but I don’t
                  anymore however the principle of calming your mind of external thoughts sticks with me and helps
                  in times of stress

      <h3>Hannah's Story</h3>
      <img src="../images/Hannah.jpg" alt="Beautiful Hijabi" width="200" height="274">
        <p>I'm Hannah studying Aeronautical Engineering at Cambridge University.
          How do I find university life? Well, it's been good. I like socialising
          with people from different courses, countries and race. It allows me to
          take advantage of the multicultural environment that we have here at Cambridge.
          Even though, it sometimes comes at the expense of my education considering the
          extensive workload, I always make sure I maintain a balance. I cope with stress
          by making time to hang out with my friends, chill out and just have some downtime.
          I recommend you to join societies where you can meet other females with similar
          interests, especially if you are studying a very male dominated course. I know,
          it gets overwhelming being at a renowned university and competing with the smartest
          people in the world but we all need that thing in our schedule that we enjoy doing
          and destresses us. I personally don’t exercise, meditate or play sports but I am the
          Vice President of the Palestinian Society at Cambridge and we've currently been
          organising events to raise money for the refugees. Contributing to a greater cause,
          makes me feel good about myself. I suggest you find your 'greater cause'!

        <h3> Melissa's Story</h3>
        <img src="../images/Melissa.jpg" alt="Grenfell Heart" width="200" height="200">
          <p>Hey, my name is Melissa. I'm studying Civil Engineering at University
            College London. I have found university challenging and only gets harder
            from one year to the next. The pressure also builds up; pressure to pass,
            pressure to find a job and pressure from personal situations outside of uni.
            When I'm stressed I tend to spend time with people I love, I find it therapeutic.
            I also find it helpful to have someone to lean on, a shoulder to cry on when
            things get tough. In truth, it's okay to feel down and it's okay to seek help
            from those around you and adore you. Carrying the burdens and expectations of
            this age is heavy and having people you trust to speak to will definitely help
            you get through. Make sure you enjoy what you study, make friends with people on
            your course so you can help each other and start working on submissions as soon as
            you get them. I'm not athletic and the university workload means you have to
            prioritise (going to the gym isnt mine), but I do find going on long walks with
            my sisters refreshing and destressing.

        <h3> Penny's Story </h3>
          <img src="../images/Penny.png" alt="Adventurous girl with monkey" width="250" height="250">
            <p>Hi my name is Penny and I am currently in my 3rd year of Veterinary
              Medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London. My University experience
              has been incredible, however there have been some bumps along the road. I failed my
              first year and found out I was dyspraxic, so that was a big learning curve for me!
              To stay positive at university I love to meet up with friends, and often go to drum n bass
              nights to dance the night away. On top of that I really love playing in my weekly netball
              league, and going to the gym. University is stressful, I’m not sure I have fully handled yet,
              but I think the key is stay organised and plan every day, but not to think too far ahead!
              My advice for other female students would be to join a sports club or society and try to
              make an impact within that club, or find a new hobby. Taking time out to focus on something
              you are passionate about other than your degree can be very fulfilling. I don’t meditate
              currently, but it’s something I’ve always wanted to get into. I often like to visit my parents,
              and take my dog for a walk, if I feel very stressed and university life is overwhelmingly busy.

        <h3> Samantha's Story </h3>
          <img src="../images/Samantha.jpg" alt="Girl in a lab coat" width="200" height="274">
              <p>Hi! I'm Samantha... studying graduate medicine at Duke NUS, Singapore.
                I graduated with a BEng in Biomedical engineering from Imperial College
                London before I moved to Singapore. Imperial … was hard work but graduate
                medicine ain't no walk in the park either. Yet, medicine is my passion so,
                I have no regrets and it's onlu up from here. The medicine program at Duke
                NUS is demanding, intensive and gratifying. I've learnt a lot in the 2 years
                and a half that I've been at NUS and only 2 more to go! University overall
                is stressful but not impossible to manage with the right mindset and attitude.
                I gym, run and love to dance a LOT. I also like to go out for dinner or drinks
                with friends on Fridays. Not to forget the occasional skype session with my
                long-distance friend Chloe from London, occasionally motivating and inspiring
                each other to always aim higher. Chloe and I both know how tough it is to be a
                female sometimes because of societal expectations. You are supposed to be this
                and you are supposed to be that. Just be who you want to be and tell society where
                to get off!!
